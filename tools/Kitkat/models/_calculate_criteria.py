'''The Concert for Bangladesh''' (or Bangla Desh, as the country's name was originally spelt)<ref name="Harry p 135">Harry, p. 135.</ref> was a pair of [[benefit concert]]s organised by former [[The Beatles|Beatles]] guitarist [[George Harrison]] and Indian [[sitar]] player [[Ravi Shankar]]. The shows were held at 2:30 and 8:00{{nbsp}}pm on Sunday, 1 August 1971, at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City, to raise international awareness of, and fund relief for refugees from [[East Pakistan]], following the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]-related [[1971 Bangladesh genocide|genocide]]. The concerts were followed by a bestselling [[The Concert for Bangladesh (album)|live album]], a boxed three-record set, and [[Apple Films]]' [[The Concert for Bangladesh (film)|concert documentary]], which opened in cinemas in the spring of 1972.

The event was the first-ever benefit of such a magnitude,<ref name="Eds of RS p 43">The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', p. 43.</ref> and featured a [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] of performers that included Harrison, fellow ex-Beatle [[Ringo Starr]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Billy Preston]], [[Leon Russell]] and the band [[Badfinger]]. In addition, Shankar and [[Ali Akbar Khan]] – both of whom had ancestral roots in Bangladesh – performed an opening set of [[Indian classical music]]. The concerts were attended by a total of 40,000 people, and the initial gate receipts raised close to $250,000 for Bangladesh relief, which was administered by [[UNICEF]].

After collecting the musicians easily, Harrison found it extremely difficult to get the recording industry to release the rights for performers to share the stage, and millions of dollars raised from the album and film were tied up in IRS tax escrow accounts for years, but the concert has been recognised as a highly successful and influential humanitarian aid project, generating both awareness and considerable funds as well as providing valuable lessons and inspiration for projects that followed, such as [[Live Aid]].<ref name="RS Encyclopedia" /><ref name="CFBD Revisited Lyons & Annan">Interviews with Charles J. Lyons and Kofi Annan, in ''The Concert for Bangladesh Revisited''.</ref><ref name="Rodriguez p 51">Rodriguez, p. 51.</ref>

By 1985, through revenue raised from the ''Concert for Bangladesh'' live album and film, an estimated $12 million had been sent to Bangladesh,<ref name="Johnston/LA Times" /> and sales of the live album and DVD release of the film continue to benefit the George Harrison Fund for UNICEF. Decades later, Shankar would say of the overwhelming success of the event: "In one day, the whole world knew the name of Bangladesh. It was a fantastic occasion."<ref name="Olivia p 286" />

==Background==
[[File:1970 Bhola cyclone track.png|thumb|left|Bhola cyclone track during the second week of November 1970]]
As [[East Pakistan]] struggled to become the separate state of [[Bangladesh]] during the 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], the political and military turmoil and [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities|associated atrocities]] led to a massive [[refugee]] problem,<ref>Lavezzoli, pp. 186–87.</ref> with at least 7 million displaced people pouring into neighbouring [[India]].<ref name="Schaffner p 146">Schaffner, p. 146.</ref> East Pakistan had recently endured devastation as a result of the [[1970 Bhola cyclone|Bhola cyclone]], and the [[Bengali people|Bengalis]]' desperate plight increased in March that year when torrential rains and floods arrived in the region,<ref name="Lavezzoli p 187">Lavezzoli, p. 187.</ref> threatening a humanitarian disaster.<ref name="Eds of RS p 42">The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', p. 42.</ref><ref name="Clayson p 308">Clayson, p. 308.</ref> Quoting figures available at the time, a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' feature claimed that up to half a million Bengalis had been killed by the cyclone in November 1970 and that the Pakistani army's subsequent campaign of slaughter under [[Operation Searchlight]] accounted for at least 250,000 civilians, "by the most conservative estimates".<ref name="Eds of RS p 123">The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', p. 123.</ref> Following the mass exodus to [[Calcutta]], a new threat arrived as the refugees faced starvation and the outbreak of diseases such as [[cholera]].<ref name="Greene p 186">Greene, p. 186.</ref><ref>Liner notes, booklet accompanying ''[[The Concert for Bangladesh (album)|The Concert for Bangladesh]]'' reissue (Sony BMG, 2005; produced by George Harrison & Phil Spector), p. 7.</ref>

[[File:George Harrison - Bangla Desh.png|thumb|right|150px|Trade ad for Harrison's "Bangla Desh" single, August 1971]]
By the first week of July,<ref name="Badman p 38">Badman, p. 38.</ref> Harrison was in a Los Angeles studio recording his purpose-written song, "[[Bangla Desh (song)|Bangla Desh]]", with co-producer [[Phil Spector]].<ref name="Leng p 112">Leng, p. 112.</ref> The song's opening verse documents Shankar's plea to Harrison for assistance,<ref>George Harrison, p. 220.</ref> and the lyrics "''My friend came to me with sadness in his eyes / Told me that he wanted help before his country dies''" provided an enduring image for what [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] later recognised as the basic human aspect behind the cause.<ref>Interview with Kofi Annan, in ''The Concert for Bangladesh Revisited''.</ref>

Harrison then met with Badfinger in London to explain that he would have to abandon work on ''Straight Up'',<ref name="Madinger & Easter p 435" /><ref name="Leng p 114">Leng, p. 114.</ref> before flying to New York on 13 July to see Lennon.<ref>Badman, pp. 39–40.</ref> During the middle of July also,<ref name="Castleman & Podrazik p 103">Castleman & Podrazik, p. 103.</ref> once back in Los Angeles, Harrison produced Shankar's Bangladesh benefit record, an [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''[[Joi Bangla]]''.<ref name="Lavezzoli p 190">Lavezzoli, p. 190.</ref> The latter featured contributions from East Bengal-born [[Ali Akbar Khan]], on [[sarod]],<ref>Lavezzoli, pp. 51, 190.</ref> and [[tabla]] player [[Alla Rakha]].<ref name="Leng p 112" /> As with Harrison's "Bangla Desh", all profits from this recording would go to the newly established George Harrison–Ravi Shankar Special Emergency Relief Fund, to be distributed by [[UNICEF]].<ref name="Schaffner p 146" />{{refn |group=nb|Around this time, a phone call went out to [[Mick Jagger]], who was forced to turn down Harrison's invitation to perform, due to [[the Rolling Stones]]' precarious situation as [[tax exile]]s in France.<ref name="Eds of RS p 123" /><ref name="Clayson p 309" />}} Also around the middle of July, the upcoming concert by "George Harrison and Friends" was announced "via a minuscule ad buried in the back pages of the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]''", author [[Nicholas Schaffner]] wrote in 1977.<ref name="Schaffner p 146" /> Tickets sold out in no time, leading to the announcement of a second show.<ref name="Tillery p 98">Tillery, p. 98.</ref><ref name="Clayson p 310" />

Towards the end of the month, when all parties were due to meet in New York for rehearsals,<ref name="Leng p 114" /> Harrison had the commitment of a backing band comprising Preston on keyboards, the four members of Badfinger on acoustic rhythm guitars and tambourine, Voormann and Keltner, on bass and drums, respectively, and saxophonist [[Jim Horn]]'s so-called "Hollywood Horns", which included [[Chuck Findley]], [[Jackie Kelso]] and Lou McCreary.<ref>Clayson, pp. 309, 310.</ref><ref name="Leng p 116">Leng, p. 116.</ref> Of the established stars, Leon Russell had committed also, but on the proviso that he be supported by members of his tour band.<ref name="O'Dell p 197" /> Eric Clapton insisted that he too would be there, even though O'Dell and other insiders, knowing of the guitarist's incapacity due to severe heroin addiction,<ref name="Spizer p 240" /> were surprised that Harrison had considered him for the occasion.<ref name="Clayson p 309" /><ref name="O'Dell pp 195–96" />

Among Harrison's former bandmates, Lennon initially agreed to take part in the concert without his wife and musical partner [[Yoko Ono]], as Harrison had apparently stipulated.<ref name="Eds of RS p 42" /><ref>Clayson, pp. 308–09.</ref> Lennon then allegedly had an argument with Ono as a result of this agreement<ref name="Alpert" /> and left New York in a rage two days before the concerts.<ref name="Clayson p 311">Clayson, p. 311.</ref><ref>Yoko Ono, [https://www.flickr.com/photos/yokoonoofficial/3385752173/ "New York City"], booklet accompanying ''[[John Lennon Anthology]]'' box set (EMI Records, 1998; produced by Yoko Ono & Rob Stevens).</ref>{{refn |group=nb|Lennon soon offered a different version of events, blaming manager [[Allen Klein]] for spreading false rumours, yet coming up with a story of his own that seemed to make a more damning case against himself: "I just didn't feel like it.

Next up was Harrison's "[[Beware of Darkness (song)|Beware of Darkness]]", with guest vocals on the third verse by Russell, who covered the song on his concurrent album, ''[[Leon Russell and the Shelter People]]'' (1971).<ref name="Spizer p 243" /> After pausing to introduce the band, Harrison followed this with one of the best-received moments in both the shows – a charging version of the [[The Beatles (album)|White Album]] track "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]", featuring him and Clapton "duelling" on lead guitar during the long instrumental playout.<ref name="Clayson p 313">Clayson, p. 313.</ref><ref>Leng, pp. 117–18.</ref> Both the band introduction and "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" are among the few selections from the afternoon show that were included on the album and in the film.<ref name="Spizer p 243" /><ref name="Madinger & Easter p 438">Madinger & Easter, p. 438.</ref> Another one was Leon Russell's medley of [[the Rolling Stones]]' "[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]" and [[the Coasters]]' "[[Young Blood (The Coasters song)|Young Blood]]",<ref name="Madinger & Easter p 438" /> which was also a highlight of Russell's live shows at the time.<ref>Bruce Eder, [{{Allmusic |class=album |id=r17175/review |pure_url=yes}} "Leon Russell ''Leon Live''"], [[AllMusic]] (retrieved 20 May 2012).</ref> With [[Don Preston (guitarist)|Don Preston]] crossing the stage to play lead guitar with Harrison, there were now temporarily four electric guitarists in the line-up.<ref name="Clayson p 313" /> Don Preston, Harrison and [[Claudia Lennear|Claudia Linnear]] supplied supporting vocals behind Russell.

In an effective change of pace,<ref name="Lavezzoli p 192" /> Harrison picked up his acoustic guitar, now alone on the stage save for [[Pete Ham]] on a second acoustic,<ref name="Matovina p 143">Matovina, p. 143.</ref> and [[Don Nix]]'s gospel choir, off to stage-left.<ref name="Leng p 119" /><ref name="Clayson p 314">Clayson, p. 314.</ref> The ensuing "[[Here Comes the Sun]]" – the first live performance of the song – was also warmly received.<ref name="Eds of RS p 43" />{{refn |group=nb|In a subsequent interview, Ham stated that Harrison only approached him about performing "Here Comes the Sun" the day before the concerts, and that the two guitarists never rehearsed the song together.<ref name="Matovina p 143" />}} At this point, Harrison switched back to his white [[Fender Stratocaster]] electric guitar and, as recounted to [[Anthony DeCurtis]] in 1987, he looked down at the setlist taped to the body of the guitar and saw the word "Bob" followed by a question mark.<ref name="Eds of RS p 146" /><ref name="Clayson p 314" /> "And I looked around," Harrison recalled of [[Bob Dylan]]'s entrance, "and ''he'' was so nervous – he had his guitar on and his shades – he was sort of coming on, coming ''[pumps his arms and shoulders]'' ... It was only at that moment that I knew for sure he was going to do it."<ref name="Eds of RS p 146" /> Among the audience, Schaffner wrote, there was "total astonishment" at this new arrival.<ref name="Schaffner p 146" />

As Harrison had envisaged,<ref name="Leng p 121">Leng, p. 121.</ref> Dylan's mini-set was the crowning glory of the Concert for Bangladesh for many observers.<ref name="Clayson p 314" /><ref>Heylin, p. 329.</ref> Backed by just Harrison, Russell (now playing Voormann's [[Fender Precision]] bass) and Starr on tambourine, Dylan played five of his decade-defining songs from the 1960s:<ref>The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', pp. 122–23.</ref> "[[A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall]]", "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]", "[[It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry]]", "[[Love Minus Zero/No Limit]]" and "[[Just Like a Woman]]".<ref name="Schaffner p 147">Schaffner, p. 147.</ref>

Harrison and the band then returned to perform a final segment, consisting of "[[Hear Me Lord]]" and his recent international number one hit, "[[My Sweet Lord]]", followed by the song of the moment – "[[Bangla Desh (song)|Bangla Desh]]".<ref name="Clayson p 312" />

===Evening show===
Harrison was reportedly delighted with the outcome of the first show, as was Dylan, who accompanied him back to the Park Lane Hotel afterwards.<ref name="O'Dell p 200">O'Dell, p. 200.</ref> They discussed possible changes to the [[Set list|setlist]] for the evening performance,<ref name="O'Dell p 200" /> beginning at 8&nbsp;pm.<ref name="Spizer p 241" />

The songs played and their sequence differed slightly between the first and second shows, most noticeably with Harrison's opening and closing mini-sets.<ref name="Madinger & Easter pp 436-37">Madinger & Easter, pp. 436–37.</ref> After "Wah-Wah", he brought "My Sweet Lord" forward in the order, followed by "Awaiting on You All", before handing it over to Billy Preston.<ref name="Schaffner p 147" /> The afternoon's "creaky" "Hear Me Lord" was dropped,<ref>Clayson, pp. 312–13.</ref> so that the post-Dylan band segment consisted of only two numbers: "Something", to close the show, and a particularly passionate reading of "Bangla Desh", as an [[Encore (concert)|encore]].<ref name="Leng p 118">Leng, p. 118.</ref> Dylan likewise made some changes, swapping "Blowin' in the Wind" and "It Takes a Lot to Laugh" in the order, and then playing a well-received "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]" in place of "Love Minus Zero".<ref name="Madinger & Easter pp 436-37" />

The second show was widely acknowledged as superior to the afternoon performance,<ref name="IMM p 60" /><ref>The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', pp. 121–22.</ref> although ''[[The Village Voice|Village Voice]]'' reviewer Don Heckman noted that many in the audience reacted to the Shankar–Khan opening set with a lack of respect.<ref name="Heckman">Don Heckman, [http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2010/12/george_harrison_1.php "The Event Wound Up as a Love Feast"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119044153/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2010/12/george_harrison_1.php |date=19 January 2015 }}, ''[[Village Voice]]'', 5 August 1971 (retrieved 14 May 2012).</ref> Not aiding the Indian musicians was the failure of a microphone on Rakha's hand drums, Heckman observed, so denying the crowd a vital element of the musical interplay between [[sitar]] and sarod.<ref name="Heckman" />

[[File:Billy Preston perforning in 1971.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Billy Preston, pictured in 1971]]
During the Western portion of the show, Harrison's voice was more confident this time around, the music "perhaps slightly more lustrous", according to ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.<ref>The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', pp. 121, 122.</ref> Towards the end of "That's the Way God Planned It", Preston felt compelled to get up from behind his [[Hammond organ]] and take a show-stealing boogie across the front of the stage.<ref name="Clayson p 313" /><ref name="Heckman" />

Dylan's walk-on was again the show's "real cortex-snapping moment", Heckman opined.<ref name="Heckman" /> Dylan finished his final song, "Just Like a Woman", with a victorious salute – "holding up both fists like a [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]]", ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s reviewer remarked shortly afterwards.<ref name="Eds of RS p 123" /> Following Dylan's set, Harrison introduced the band,<ref name="Madinger & Easter pp 436-37" /> before taking the show "to yet another peak" with "Something".<ref name="Eds of RS p 123" /> Watching from the wings, [[Pattie Boyd|Pattie Harrison]] described her husband's performance throughout that evening as "magnificent".<ref name="O'Dell p 202">O'Dell, p. 202.</ref>

Harrison's manager, [[Allen Klein]], immediately boasted of the entirely peaceful nature of the event: "There was no rioting. Not one policeman was allowed in there&nbsp;...

The appearance of Bob Dylan on the same stage as two former Beatles caused a sensation,<ref>Sounes, p. 267.</ref><ref name="Schaffner p 148">Schaffner, p. 148.</ref> and lavish praise was bestowed on George Harrison.<ref name="Rodriguez p 51" /><ref>Woffinden, pp. 51, 52.</ref> "[[Beatlemania]] Sweeps a City!" was a typical headline,<ref name="Clayson p 327">Clayson, p. 327.</ref> and in Britain the ''[[NME]]'' declared the concerts "The Greatest Rock Spectacle of the Decade!"<ref name="Badman p 45" /> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' described the artists' performances as "their best music ever" and commented on the likelihood of a live album from the concerts: "there is no politics involved.

Dylan's choice of songs, particularly the "apocalyptic" "A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall",<ref name="Leng p 118" /> were found to have a new relevance in the context of the early 1970s<ref name="Spizer p 244">Spizer, p. 244.</ref> – the words made "the more chilling for the passage of years", opined ''Rolling Stone''.<ref name="Eds of RS p 121">The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', p. 121.</ref> The same publication stated of Starr's contribution: "Seeing Ringo Starr drumming and singing on stage has a joy in it that is one of the happiest feelings on earth still."<ref name="Schaffner p 148" /> Ravi Shankar's role as concert instigator and the true conscience of the UNICEF shows was also noted.<ref name="Eds of RS p 123" /><ref name="Badman p 44" /> Musically, ''The Village Voice'' observed, the pairing of Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan was "almost as unique as the mix of Dylan and Harrison".<ref name="Heckman" />

In the wider [[counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural]] context of the time, with disillusion increasingly rife with each post-[[Woodstock]] rock event,<ref name="Heckman" /><ref name="Schaffner p 148" /> commentators viewed the concerts as, in the words of ''Rolling Stone'', "a brief incandescent revival of all that was best about the Sixties".<ref>The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', pp. 121, 154.</ref> Writing in 1981, ''NME'' critic [[Bob Woffinden]] likened it to a "rediscovery of faith", adding: "Harrison had put rock music back on course."<ref name="Woffinden p 51" />

Among Harrison's biographers, [[Alan Clayson]] describes the 1971–72 period covering the concerts and their associated releases as "the George Harrison Moment",<ref>Clayson, p. 318.</ref> while [[Gary Tillery]] states: "The Concert for Bangladesh sealed Harrison's stature as something more than just a major celebrity&nbsp;... He changed the perception of recording artists, making it clear they could be good world citizens too – willing to set aside their egos and paychecks in order to help people who were suffering."<ref>Tillery, p. 100.</ref> According to [[Niaz Alam]], writing in the ''[[Dhaka Tribune]]'', "On artistic merit alone, as encapsulated in the film and LP, the Concert for Bangladesh perhaps holds up better than Woodstock in showcasing the best of its era in terms of music, optimism, and goodwill."<ref name="Alam/DhakaTribune" />

Harrison's musical biographer, Simon Leng, identifies friendship as the key factor behind the success of the two UNICEF shows, both in bringing all the participants together on the stage and in the affection with which the audience and music critics viewed the event.<ref name="Leng p 120">Leng, p. 120.</ref> Klaus Voormann, a close friend of Harrison's since 1960, has often cited this quality as well.<ref name="Sullivan" /><ref name="Klaus/Scorsese" />

Harry said that, given the influence of the event and Harrison's other charitable activities, and also how his company [[HandMade Films]] "virtually revived the British film industry", it was "difficult to equate" his [[Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|MBE]] status (which he gained in 1965 as a member of the Beatles) with the knighthoods or other higher orders lavished on the likes of [[Bob Geldof]], comedians, pop stars and other figures in the music business.<ref name="Harry p 135" />{{refn|group=nb|[[Geoffrey Cannon]], in a 2019 update accompanying the re-publication at [[Rock's Backpages]] of his 1972 ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' review of the ''[[The Concert for Bangladesh (album)|Concert for Bangladesh]]'' live album, said this lack of state recognition for Harrison was "inexplicable", given that McCartney was knighted in 1997 and Shankar was awarded the Indian equivalent in 2001.<ref>Geoffrey Cannon, "George Harrison & Friends: ''The Concert for Bangladesh'' (Apple)", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 4 January 1972; available at [https://rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/george-harrison--friends-ithe-concert-for-bangladeshi-apple Rock's Backpages] (subscription required).</ref>}}

==Funds and controversy==
<!--[[File:Concert For Bangladesh Cover.jpg|thumbnail|left|160px|Cover of the 2005 reissue of the ''Concert for Bangladesh'' DVD]]-->
The two Madison Square Garden shows raised US$243,418.50, which was given to [[UNICEF]] to administer on 12 August 1971.<ref name="Badman p 45" /> By December, [[Capitol Records]] presented a cheque to [[Apple Corps]] for around $3,750,000 for advance sales of the ''[[The Concert for Bangladesh (album)|Concert for Bangladesh]]'' live album.<ref name="Badman p 58">Badman, p. 58.</ref><ref>Harry, p. 136.</ref>

Aside from complaints regarding the high retail price for the three-record set, particularly in Britain<ref>Carr & Tyler, p. 99.</ref> – a result of the government's refusal to waive its tax surcharge – controversy soon surrounded the project's fundraising.<ref name="Eds of RS p 43" /> Most importantly, Klein had failed to register the event as a UNICEF benefit beforehand,<ref name="Lavezzoli p 193" /><ref>Soocher, pp. xii, 200.</ref> and it was subsequently denied [[tax exemption|tax-exempt]] status by the US Government.<ref name="Clayson p 316" /> As a result, most of the money was held in an [[Internal Revenue Service]] [[escrow]] account for ten years.<ref name="Lavezzoli p 193">Lavezzoli, p. 193.</ref><ref name="Woffinden p 52">Woffinden, p. 52.</ref> In an interview with [[Derek Taylor]] for his [[I, Me, Mine|autobiography]] in the late 1970s, Harrison put this figure at between $8&nbsp;million and $10&nbsp;million.<ref name="IMM p 61" /> Before then, in early 1972, ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine reported that some of the proceeds remained unaccounted for and had found their way into Klein's accounts.<ref name="Schaffner p 148" /><ref name="Woffinden p 51" /> Klein responded by suing the magazine for $150&nbsp;million in damages,<ref>Jay Cocks, [https://web.archive.org/web/20071001004315/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944505,00.html "Sweet Sounds"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 17 April 1972 (retrieved 12 December 2006).</ref> and although the suit was later withdrawn, the accusations attracted unwelcome scrutiny at a time when questions were also being asked about Klein's mismanagement of the Beatles' finances.<ref name="Clayson pp 332−33">Clayson, pp. 332–33.</ref><ref name="Badman p 72">Badman, p. 72.</ref> That year, an estimated $2&nbsp;million had gone to the refugees via UNICEF before the IRS audit of Apple got under way; finally, in 1981, $8.8&nbsp;million was added to that total following the audit.<ref name="RS Encyclopedia">''The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'', p. 419.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Klein's handling of the Bangladesh project, and the suspicion of financial impropriety on his part,<ref>Rodriguez, p. 137.</ref> was one of the main reasons that Harrison, Lennon and Starr chose not to renew his management contract in March 1973.<ref>Doggett, pp. 192–93.</ref> In their lawsuit against Klein in November that year, they cited his failure to prearrange official charity status for the event, among several other complaints.<ref>Doggett, p. 212.</ref>}}

By June 1985, according to an article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', nearly $12&nbsp;million had been sent to Bangladesh for relief.<ref name="Johnston/LA Times">David Johnston, "Bangladesh: The Benefit That Almost Wasn't", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 2 June 1985, p. R3.</ref> Around this time, according to music journalist [[Mikal Gilmore]], Harrison gave Geldof "meticulous advice" to ensure that Live Aid's estimated £50&nbsp;million found its way, as intended, to victims of the [[1984–1985 famine in Ethiopia|Ethiopian famine]].<ref name="Eds of RS p 43" /> In an interview to promote the 1991 CD release of ''The Concert for Bangladesh'', Harrison said that $13.5&nbsp;million had been raised in the early 1970s, from the concert and the accompanying album and film. He added that, while this figured paled in comparison to ventures such as Live Aid, "you have to remember, that was at a time when nobody was really aware of this kind of benefit concert, certainly there hadn't been anything like that, and, of course, $13.5&nbsp;million back then was probably much more than it's worth now."<ref>Harry, p. 137.</ref>

Speaking in the 1990s, Harrison said of the Bangladesh relief effort: "Now it's all settled and the UN own the rights to it themselves, and I think there's been about 45 million dollars made."<ref>Huntley, p. 82.</ref> Sales of the DVD and CD of the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh continue to benefit the cause,<ref>Ingham, p. 133.</ref> now known as the George Harrison Fund for UNICEF.<ref name="Friends">''The Concert for Bangladesh Revisited''.</ref><ref name="GH Fund4UNICEF">[http://www.unicefusa.org/news/news-from-the-field/the-george-harrison-fund-for-u.html "The George Harrison Fund for UNICEF asks 'Help us save some lives': Concert for Bangladesh 40th Anniversary"], [[UNICEF]], 13 October 2011 (retrieved 30 October 2013).</ref>

==In popular culture==
The Concert for Bangladesh was satirised in two episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'': "[[Like Father, Like Clown]]" and "[[I'm with Cupid]]". In the former, [[Krusty the Clown|Krusty]] plays the album while a visitor at the Simpsons household.<ref>Richmond & Coffman, p. 67.</ref> In "I'm with Cupid", [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]]'s record collection contains ''The Concert Against Bangladesh'', which features a picture of a mushroom cloud on the cover,<ref>Harry, p. 344.</ref> reflecting contemporary Indian−Pakistani nuclear rivalry in the region.<ref>Benjamin Robinson, [https://web.archive.org/web/20000816013825/http://www.snpp.com/episodes/AABF11 "I'm With Cupid/AABF11"], The Simpsons Archive, 21 September 1999 (archived version retrieved 5 December 2015).</ref>

The July 1974 ("Dessert") issue of ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' magazine satirised [[Tom Wilkes]]' original cover design for ''The Concert for Bangladesh'', by using a chocolate version of the starving child, the head of which has had a bite taken out of it.<ref>Mark Simonson, [http://www.marksverylarge.com/issues/7407.html "''National Lampoon'' Issue #52 – Dessert"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723175648/http://www.marksverylarge.com/issues/7407.html |date=23 July 2008 }}, marksverylarge.com (retrieved 15 October 2012).</ref> Two years before this, the National Lampoon team spoofed Harrison's humanitarian role on record, in their track "The Concert in Bangla Desh" on the ''[[Radio Dinner]]'' album.<ref name="Rodriguez pp 96-97">Rodriguez, pp. 96–97.</ref> In the sketch, two Bangladeshi stand-up comedians (played by [[Tony Hendra]] and [[Christopher Guest]]) perform to starving refugees in an attempt to collect a bowlful of rice so that "George Harrison" can mount a [[hunger strike]].<ref name="Rodriguez pp 96-97" /><ref>Mark Simonson, [http://www.marksverylarge.com/recordings/radiodinner.html "''National Lampoon Radio Dinner'' (1972)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125175408/http://marksverylarge.com/recordings/radiodinner.html |date=25 November 2010 }}, marksverylarge.com (retrieved 21 October 2012).</ref>

Crowd noises from the Concert for Bangladesh were put into [[Aerosmith]]'s cover of "[[Train Kept A-Rollin']]" by producer [[Jack Douglas (record producer)|Jack Douglas]].<ref>Greg Prato, [http://www.allmusic.com/song/the-train-kept-a-rollin-mt0005989550 "Aerosmith 'Train Kept A-Rollin'"], [[AllMusic]] (retrieved 15 October 2012).</ref> Some of stills photographer [[Barry Feinstein]]'s shots from the 1971 concerts were used on the covers of subsequent albums by the participating artists, notably the compilations ''[[Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II]]'' and ''[[The History of Eric Clapton]]''.<ref name="Woffinden p 51">Woffinden, p. 51.</ref><ref>Interview with Barry Feinstein, in ''The Concert for Bangladesh Revisited''.</ref>

Harrison himself sent up the benefit-show concept on film, in the 1985 HandMade comedy ''[[Water (1985 film)|Water]]''.<ref>Badman, p. 351.</ref> At the so-called Concert for Cascara, he, Starr, Clapton, [[Jon Lord]] and others make a surprise appearance on stage, supposedly before the [[United Nations General Assembly]], performing the song "Freedom".<ref>Leng, p. 239.</ref>
